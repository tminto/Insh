<span class="poemtitle">Captive</span><p>
I am captive, drowning rapidly <br>
I am a prisoner of my dreams<br>
The truth never being what it seems<br> 
My passions cry out wanting to be free <br>
Pain is an obstruction haunting me <br>
While trials to purify my soul clean<br>
Are disillusioned by wasted means<br>
Survival has curtailed my reality<br>
I am prisoner of deception<br>
Left alone to cry<br>
I am a captive of perceptions<br>
Trapped with questions of why<br>
I am slowly sinking pulled by bait<br>
While time for me, will not wait<br>

<span class="poemtitle">You Can't Stop My Shine</span><p>
I wish I could write a different script<br>
One where I believe in me<br>
And trust the Creator<br>
Using His love as an elevator<br>
To elevate to a higher level<br>
<br>
I wish I could write a different script<br>
One Where I am whole<br>
Not sliced to pieces<br>
Unable to see my choices<br>
<br>
I wish I could write a different script<br>
One where I am able to see pass the darkness<br>
That blackens my heart and soul<br>
Making me inhuman<br>
Making me unfit<br>
So I can fit into a cancerous mold<br>

Why do I create my destiny <br>
based on a history <br>
of lies I sold<br>
I am the beauty I stole<br>

I am the Queen<br>
The Warrior<br>
The Conqueror<br>
The anything <br>
and the everything <br>
And I Can't Forget<br>
And I Won't Forget<br>
I CAN write a different script<br>

<span class="poemtitle">The Feast</span><p>
Social Statuses<br>
overly baked with racist attitudes<br>
crusting over and under the filing<br>
leaving the feeling....<br>
straddling us into believing<br> 
the chains are still here<br>
sentenced to a life of strife<br>
imprisoned by our empty visions<br>
What is your story?<br>
The activist whose time in the light is drained in the golden hues of the setting sun<br>
energy of the present unwinding<br>
the force of what was done<br>
What is your story?<br>
The child who soaked and bathed in the glory of the risk takers<br>
risking their lives...dying for our life<br>
The dreamer<br>
The visionary<br>
Activism breathing life into veins<br>
Taking its course for a life charged<br>
Working to remind... <br>
Working to remember when sobering reality hits....<br>
it was all not in vain<br>
What is your story?<br>
The angry<br>
Dreams Shut Down<br>
Ensnared into redundant cycles of victimization<br>
punishing you without knowing you<br>
Used as a weapon<br>
to remind...<br>
What happens to a dream deferred...<br>
Victim...<br>
to hope lost<br>
to recycled lies<br>
promise<br>
lacerated<br>
time squeezed<br>
laced with feasts of fury<br>
tastes sourly sweet<br>
fury mounting upon fury<br>
Truth and Justice for All?<br>
Lying...in tuned...<br>
Waiting to consume<br>
What is your story?<br>
Disconnected from all<br>
Throw it Up! Throw it Up!<br>
That's how we ball out!<br>
Wind Chasing You<br>
Above it all<br>
that's how YOU ball<br>
Rollin' <br>
carried by shallow currents<br>
money driven blinds healing purpose<br>
Feeding from satan's sweetest intoxicants<br>
What is your story?<br>
Is it untold?<br>
DId it fold?<br>
Or does it lay...<br>
Submissively waiting for its day<br>
